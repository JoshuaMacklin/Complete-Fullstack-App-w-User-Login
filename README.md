# Made with:
####  HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Express, EJS, Mongodb, Node.js, 

# Lesson Learned:
#### I started off using Node.js with the Express framework. Using CRUD, the full stack app with the MongoDB database is able to get, post, put and delete requests at the users leisure. Finishing off with creating an EJS template that allowed the DOM to be altered whenever new information from the database arose.
